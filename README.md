# Sentimental-Analysis-IBM
Description
During my 6-week internship at IBM SkillBuild, I had the opportunity to create a fascinating project that involved sentiment analysis on restaurant reviews using Python and AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup Language). This project's primary goal was to develop a system that could automatically determine the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of restaurant reviews, providing valuable insights for both restaurant owners and potential customers.

Key Features:

Utilized Python for data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.
Applied Natural Language Processing techniques for text analysis.
Implemented sentiment analysis using AIML, a markup language for building chatbots and conversational AI.
Integrated AIML models to classify restaurant reviews.
Created a user-friendly interface for real-time sentiment analysis of new reviews.
Provided a comprehensive report of sentiment trends over time.
This project showcases my proficiency in Python, NLP, and AIML, and how these skills can be applied to real-world problems in the domain of customer feedback analysis
